						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Employment Opportunities</h5>
						<p>The United States offers many different job opportunities that allow foreign students to work in America both during and after college. Foreign students may obtain on-campus employment, optional practical training, curricular practical training, and employment with an international organization. In certain circumstances, a student may prove severe economic hardship to obtain these types of positions. Each different type of work has different criteria that must be met for employment eligibility.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="grid_6">
						<div class="study_list">
						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</h5>
						<p>Some degree programs require hands-on work or internships for completion of the degree. Curricular practical training allows foreign students to complete these requirements, and students can get paid for this type of work. It is important to note that students who are employed full-time through a CPT training program for 12 months or more are not eligible for OPT training. The school's International Student Office can help make sure all guidelines are being followed so that OPT eligibility is not compromised.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="serContainer">
					<div class="grid_6">
						<div class="study_list">
						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Employment with an International Organization</h5>
						<p>This type of employment is often overlooked because these opportunities are less common. Students must have a job offer and sponsorship from an organization that is recognized by the U.S. State Department. These types of jobs still allow for eligibility through CPT and OPT programs. These positions require that the job be within the scope of the organization's sponsorship and within the field of the student's study. Students must have an F-1 Visa in good standing for 9 months for eligibility.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="grid_6">
						<div class="study_list">
						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">On-Campus Employment</h5>
						<p>On-campus opportunities provide a source of income, but these jobs usually do not provide sufficient funds to cover all living expenses. Many schools require that students get approval for these jobs through the International Student Office and most of them require waiting until either the first semester of study or first year of study is complete to qualify. Under the F-1 visa status, students can work up to 20 hours per week, but their employment must not take a job away from a U.S. resident. The number of these types of jobs is limited; so on-campus job opportunities may or may not be available at a particular school.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="serContainer">
					<div class="grid_6">
						<div class="study_list">
						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Optional Practical Training (OPT)</h5>
						<p>Optional practical training status permits international students with a valid F-1 visa to work off-campus during and after completing a degree. This type of employment is governed by rules of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and requires authorization from both the school's International Student Office and the USCIS. Applying for Optional Practical Training opportunities requires that a student be enrolled in school for at least 9 months. A job offer is not required in order to apply, and OPT employment can be secured anywhere in the U.S. Applications must be received before the degree is completed. Apply for this as early as possible as these applications can take up to 9 months to process. All U.S. job opportunities are contingent upon maintaining lawful F-1 status. After completion of a degree, this type of work must be full-time and must be completed within 14 months of earning a degree.

					<div class="grid_6">
						<div class="study_list">
						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Severe Economic Hardship</h5>
						<p>When international students face unforeseen economic hardship, the USCIS does allow for special-circumstance eligibility that allows the F-1 student to work off-campus for up to 20 hours per week. Students who want to be considered for this status must have been in valid F-1 status for at least 9 months, be in good standing academically, be able to provide evidence of economic hardship that was based on unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control, and prove that on-campus employment is unavailable or insufficient. The student must receive an Employment Authorization Document from the USCIS before work can begin.</p>

				<div class="serContainer">
					<div class="grid_6">
						<div class="study_list">
						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Benefits of U.S. Student Employment Opportunities</h5>
						<p>In addition to receiving training and income, international students who have U.S. based work experience are more likely to get interviews with U.S. firms and more likely to get hired by those firms. Having a job offer from an American company greatly increases the likelihood of getting approved for a green card, which can lead to U.S. citizenship.</p>
