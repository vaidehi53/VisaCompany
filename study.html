						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">First-Class Education</h5>
						<p>American universities provide a first-class education that allows student access to cutting-edge technologies and research.  Many programs partner with industry leaders in various fields to provide students with hands-on training, including internships, within their respective fields of study.  This provides job experience and insights into an industry from an inside perspective. International students have the option of pursuing higher level degrees from U.S. universities, including Master's degrees and Ph. D.'s. Accredited degrees from recognized schools lead to opportunities worldwide.</p>

						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Flexible, Customized Academic Programs</h5>
						<p>American universities offer flexible academic programs that let students choose when they want to attend classes, how many classes they want to take at one time, and they also let students choose their own electives. Since the United States has so many colleges and universities, programs that provide in-depth training are available for almost any subject a student might want to study. The US education system is set up in a way that allows students to choose two primary areas of focus:  a major and a minor. Most programs also require general introductory courses in a variety of foundational subjects.</p>

						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">World-wide Recognition</h5>
						<p>Some of the most prestigious schools in the world are in the United States.  In fact, Quacquarelli Symonds World University ranking places 13 American schools on its top 20 list. Universities such as Harvard, Stanford, Julliard, Berkley, and MIT are all internationally recognized U.S. Schools, and each one of those institutions welcomes international students. Graduates from programs at these schools have access to professors who are leaders in their respective fields, and classmates who will be future industry leaders. People with degrees from such institutions are highly sought-after worldwide by employers who want to hire people with degrees from highly-esteemed Universities.</p>

						<div class="study_list">
						<h5 class="fa-arrow-circle-right">Connections with Industry Leaders</h5>
						<p>Students who study in the US are often studying directly under professors who are highly respected in their fields. Some universities hire famous lecturers and researchers to teach courses relating their fields of study. Developing connections with such highly esteemed mentors can be of great benefit after graduation. Internships can even lead to permanent employment directly upon graduation. For those who would like to extend their stay in the United States beyond their student visa, finding professional employment opens up the possibility of obtaining a work visa, which can also lead to permanent residency (Green Card) and then U.S. citizenship! </p>
